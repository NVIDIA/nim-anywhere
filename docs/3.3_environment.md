# Managing your Developement Environment

## Environment Variables

Most of the configuration for the development environment happens with Environment Variables. To make permanent changes to environment variables, modify [`variables.env`](./variables.env) or use the Workbench UI.

## Python Environment Packages

This project uses one Python environment at `/usr/bin/python3` and dependencies are managed with `pip`. Becuse all development is done inside a container, any changes to the Python environment will be ephemeral. To permanently install a Python package, add it to the [`requirements.txt`](./requirements.txt) file or use the Workbench UI.

## Operating System Configuration

The development environment is based on Ubuntu 22.04. The primary user has password-less sudo access, but all changes to the system will be ephemeral. To make permanent changes to installed packages, add them to the [`apt.txt`] file. To make other changes to the operating system such as manipulating files, adding environment variables, etc; use the [`postBuild.bash`](./postBuild.bash) and [`preBuild.bash`](./preBuild.bash) files.
