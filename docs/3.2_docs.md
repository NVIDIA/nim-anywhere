## Updating documentation

The README is rendered automatically; direct edits will be overwritten. In order to modify the README you will need to edit the files for each section separately. All of these files will be combined and the README will be automatically generated. You can find all of the related files in the `docs` folder.

Documentation is written in Github Flavored Markdown and then rendered to a final Markdown file by Pandoc. The details for this process are defined in the Makefile. The order of files generated are defined in `docs/_TOC.md`. The documentation can be previewed in the Workbench file browser window.

### Header file

The header file is the first file used to compile the documentation. This file can be found at `docs/_HEADER.md`. The contents of this file will be written verbatim, without any manipulation, to the README before anything else.

### Summary file

The summary file contains quick description and graphic that describe this project. The contents of this file will be added to the README immediately after the header and just before the table of contents. This file is processed by Pandoc to embed images before writing to the README.

### Table of Contents file

The most important file for the documentation is the table of contents file at `docs/_TOC.md`. This file defines a list of files that should be concatenated in order to generate the final README manual. Files must be on this list to be included.

### Static Content

Save all static content, including images, to the `_static` folder. This will help with organization.

### Dynamic documentation

It may be helpful to have documents that update and write themselves. To create a dynamic document, simply create an executable file that writes the Markdown formatted document to stdout. During build time, if an entry in the table of contents file is executable, it will be executed and its stdout will be used in its place.

### Rendering documentation

When a documentation related commit is pushed, a GitHub Action will render the documentation. Any changes to the README will be automatially committed.
