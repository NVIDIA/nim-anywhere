## Updating documentation

Documentation is written in Github Flavored Markdown and then rendered to a final Markdown file by Pandoc. The documentation can be previewed in the Workbench file browser window.

### Header file

The header file is the first file used to compile the documentation. This file can be found at `docs/_HEADER.md`. The contents of this file will be written verbatim, without any manipulation, to the README before anything else.

### Summary file

The summary file contains quick description and graphic that describe this project. The contents of this file will be added to the README immediately after the header and just before the table of contents. This file is processed by Pandoc to embed images before writing to the README.

### Table of Contents file

The most important file for the documentation is the table of contents file at `docs/_TOC.md`. This file defines a list of files that should be concatenated in order to generate the final README manual. Files must be on this list to be included.

### Static Content

Save all static content, including images, to the `_static` folder. This will help with organization.

### Dynamic documentation

It may be helpful to have documents that update and write themselves. To create a dynamic document, simply create an executable file that writes the Markdown formatted document to stdout. During build time, if an entry in the table of contents file is executable, it will be executed and its stdout will be used in its place.

### Rendering documentation

`Make` is used to manage the generation of the `README.md` file. Running the following make commands from the `docs/` directory will perform the following actions.

- `make` or `make ../README.md` will update the README file if any of the pages have changed since it was last generated.

- `make clean` will cleanup the existing README and static assets.

- `make all` will force the generation of the README manual.
