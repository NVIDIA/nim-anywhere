## Populating the Knowledge Base

To get started developing demos, a sample dataset is provided along with a Jupyter Notebook showing how data is ingested into a Vector Database.

  1. To import PDF documentation into the vector Database, open Jupyter using the app launcher in AI Workbench.

  1. Use the Jupyter Notebook at `code/upload-pdfs.ipynb` to ingest the default dataset. If using the default dataset, no changes are necessary.

  1. If using a custom dataset, upload it to the `data/` directory in Jupyter and modify the provided notebook as necessary.
