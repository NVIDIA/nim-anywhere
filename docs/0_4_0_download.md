## Download this project

There are two ways to download this project for local use: Cloning and Forking.

Cloning this repository is the recommended way to start. This will not allow for local modifications, but is the fastest to get started. This also allows for the easiest way to pull updates.

Forking this repository is recommended for development as changes will be able to be saved. However, to get updates, the fork maintainer will have to regularly pull from the upstream repo. To work from a fork, follow [GitHub's instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and then reference the URL to your personal fork in the rest of this section.
