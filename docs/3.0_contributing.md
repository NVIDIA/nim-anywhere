## Code Style

This project has been configured with Linters that have been tuned to help the code remain consistent while not being overly burdensome. We use the following Linters:

- Bandit is used for security scanning
- Pylint is used for Python Syntax Linting
- MyPy is used for type hint linting
- Black is configured for code styling
- A custom check is run to ensure Jupyter Notebooks do not have any output
- Another custom check is run to ensure the README.md file is up to date

The embedded VSCode environment is configured to run the linting and checking in realtime.

To manually run the linting that is done by the CI pipelines, execute `/project/code/tools/lint.sh`. Individual tests can be run be specifying them by name: `/project code/tools/lint.sh [deps|pylint|mypy|black|docs|fix]`. Running the lint tool in fix mode will automatically correct what it can by running Black, updating the README, and clearing the cell output on all Jupyter Notebooks.
