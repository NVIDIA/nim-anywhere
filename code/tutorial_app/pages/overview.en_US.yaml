  #### Welcome

  This is the AI Workbench Live Labs, an interactive guide to the features of NVIDIA AI Workbench.

  It will help you learn by doing instead of only reading the docs.

  However, you should feel free to work through the [docs](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/introduction.html)
  on your own or with the assistance of an LLM.

  It is organized into **exercises** that are divided into **tasks**.

  Completing each **task** unlocks content for the exercise and will give you feedback.

      ###### Use the Sidebar to navigate this guide (click the :arrow_forward: icon in the top left to expand it)
      There are three sections of exercises, and each exercise is organized into tasks. Completing
      tasks unlocks more content in the exercise.

      1. **Basic** explores core concepts and the Desktop App UI. (15 mins)
      2. **Advanced** digs deeper to show example workflows. (20 mins - 1 hour)
      3. **Sneak Peek** previews "in-early-development" features that will be stable soon.

    response: Ok. Let's get started. **Make sure the Desktop App is running with the view for this project visible.**

  - name: The AI Workbench Desktop App
    msg: |
      ##### AI Workbench is a free development platform that helps you:
      * **Connect** to and work on remote systems as if they were local.
      * **Develop** in containerized environments.
      * **Manage** development environments across local and remote systems.

      ##### The user experience is handled through views and tabs.

      - **Main Locations View**: For managing and accessing remote systems
      - **Single Location View**: For managing and accessing different projects on a single system
      - **Project Tab**: For managing and working with a single project

      ![overview](app/static/overview/cascade.png)
      ##### There are three basics steps to get working:
      1. You select a **location** to work in (*local* is default)
      2. You create or select a **project** to work on
      3. You start a **web app** or an **IDE** to do your work in the project

      ###### If you've gotten this far, you've already done all of these steps.

  - name: Starting JupyterLab
    msg: |
      ###### Let's begin with the most basic thing possible in a Workbench project, starting JupyterLab.
      - Go to the Desktop App and the Project View for this project
      - Find the large green button at the top right and click the drop down
      - Select JupyterLab
      - Wait for JupyterLab to open in your default browser.

      ![dropdown](app/static/overview/dropdown.png)

    response: Great. JupyterLab is running.

  - name: Stopping JupyterLab
    msg: |
      ###### Now let's do the second most basic thing possible, stopping JupyterLab.
      - Go to the project view for this project and click the **Project Dashboard**
      - Scroll down a little to see the **Project Container** section
      - You will see that both this Tutorial app and JupyterLab are running
      - Click the JupyterLab toggle to stop it.

    response: You stopped JupyterLab.

  - name: Finishing Up the Overview
    msg: |
      ###### Objective sources for help and validation are important, so don't be shy about asking for help.

      If something goes wrong or you are confused, work through the following steps:

      1. Click the green :material/book_4: button to see our troubleshooting guide.
      2. Click the green :material/help: button to see crowd sourced answers in the NVIDIA Developer Forum.
      3. If you find a bug, click the :material/bug_report: button in the sidebar to create a report on GitHub.
      4. If all else fails, email us at `aiworkbench-support@nvidia.com`.

    response: Awesome. Let's get started!
