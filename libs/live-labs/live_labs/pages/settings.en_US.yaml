  A **Support Bundle** is a collection of logs that capture the state of your AI Workbench. To create a support bundle to send in for troubleshooting, first open the AI Workbench CLI (use the WSL distro if on Windows)

  Then, run the following command(s):

  ```bash
  nvwb support create-bundle
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  nvwb support create-bundle --context <location name>
  ```
